# Chapter 3 - *Functions*

### Small!

- The first rule of functions is that they should be <b>small</b>.
- Functions should hardly ever be *20* lines long.

### Do One Thing

- FUNCTIONS SHOULD <b>DO ONE THING</b>. THEY SHOULD <b>DO IT WELL</b>. THEY SHOULD <b>DO IT ONLY</b>.

### One Level of Abstraction per Function

- In order to make sure our functions are doing “one thing,” we need to make sure that the statements within our function are all at the <b>same level of abstraction</b>
 
- Mixing levels of abstraction within a function is always confusing.
